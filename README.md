### Wyam Blog Boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for the Wyam static site generator, based on the BlogTemplate theme using the blog recipe. The point of this repo is to provide a good starting point for creating new blogs with Wyam. It's a slightly opinionated boilerplate based on which settings and what kind of a structure I find optimal.

#### What does it include?
* Pre-loaded with fake posts so that you can easily check css styling for different elements generated from the markdown files.
* Some settings like https enabled by default.
* A custom version of the BlogTemplate theme that includes extra metatags and a slightly different structure.
* A folder structure for assets.
